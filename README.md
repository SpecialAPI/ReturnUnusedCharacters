# Cut Characters Reborn

Cut Characters Reborn aims to bring back the three characters that were cut from Enter the Gungeon during development: Lamey the Detective, the Cosmonaut, and the Ninja. Currently this mod only adds Lamey.

Lamey, the Detective:
* Starts with the Lamey Gun, Disguise Kit, and Magnifying Glass.
* Fully sprited, featuring custom Punchout sprites and healthcards.
* 4 unlockable weapons and 3 unlockable items, including her starter items.
* Unlockable alt costume and alt starter! Beat the Dragun with Lamey to unlock the former, and beat it while using the alt costume to unlock the alt starter.  

The command to unlock every item in the mod is `ccr unlock_everything`.
